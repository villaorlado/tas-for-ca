## üñ• Usage Overview

### Initial Setup

1. Select Directory: Click the "Select Directory" button to choose the folder containing your video screenshots (each video is represented by its own folder).
2. Select TXT Folder: Click the "Select TXT Folder" button to specify where the annotation files should be stored (one .txt file per video).

### Main Interface Navigation

1. Directory Overview: After selecting a directory, you'll see:
- Total files count (e.g., 40118 shown in the example)
- List of subfolders, each representing a video
- Number of images in each subfolder
- Green checkmarks indicating which videos already have saved labels

2. Video Navigation: When viewing a specific video (subfolder):
- Use "Main" button to return to the directory overview
- Use "Previous Video" and "Next Video" buttons to move between videos
- The current subfolder name is displayed (e.g., "-kUc0fCip28")

### Labeling Process

1. Import or Create Labels:
- If a TXT file is available for the current video, you can click "Import Labels"
- Alternatively, create new labels by typing in the "Enter label name" field and clicking "Add Label"

2. Apply Labels to Images:
- Click on a label (e.g., "Interlude") to activate it
- Click on the video frames/images you want to apply this label to Images with labels appear with a red border and the label name beneath them

3. Save Your Work:
- Click "Save Labels to TXT" to store your annotations in the specified text file

The TXT File Analysis section shows statistics about your labels (e.g., 60.2% of frames labeled as "Interlude")

## Additional Features

- Click "Clear" buttons to reset your workspace when needed
- The interface shows unique labels found in TXT files
- A color picker is available when creating new labels

This workflow allows you to efficiently label frames across multiple videos and save that information in a structured format for further analysis.
